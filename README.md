# Get-Chrome-Cache
A PERL Script to Extract all Files Saved within the local Chrome/Chromium Cache

## *Basics*
This script file is designed for use by any-user (no root access required) within a Terminal. It’s principal purpose is to make it easy & reliable to extract all files from the current Chrome / Chromium cache into a dir of your choice. These are mostly various image & text files. In addition to PERL, the main utilities required are BROTLI, CONVERT (part of ImageMagick-ims6.q16 suite), DD, GUNZIP & TOUCH. These are Apps are tested at program start to make sure that they are available. Also within the *Global CONSTANTS* are `$IN` & `$OUT`:–

* `$IN` : disk location for the CHROME Cache
* `$OUT` : disk location for files extracted from the CHROME Cache

## *Begin*
The following will assume that you have created a dir `~/.local/sbin` within which you store the bash-file; this is to set the script as executable for current user only:

```bash
$ chmod 0700 ~/.local/sbin/getCC
$ la ~/.local/sbin/getCC
-rwx------ 1 user user 24137 May 31 20:50 /home/user/.local/sbin/getCC
```
## *Help*
No parameters are required. However, you *do* need to check every *Global CONSTANT*, and make sure that you have created a user-accessible dir `$OUT` to catch all output. The script will begin immediately to extract ALL accessible files at launch; here is the beginning of an example obtained just now (the script counts up as each file is extracted) with `head` & `tail` after interruption (you will notice that the script creates a thumbnail for every image, and gzipped/brotlied files are zipped up):

```bash
$ ~/.local/sbin/getCC
Checking required installations … (all required apps appear to be installed just fine)
Now extract files into $OUT=/home/user/Personal/ChromeCache/Files:

… and now a full extraction sequence with timings (those errors are *normal*; your browser hides them from you in the background then — for some bizarre reason — caches the file(s) nonetheless):–

PS    Stat extracts have been put in place to be able to use YAD (Yet Another Dialog) and tested by me as working, then I've lost that section of code. Ooops. Pull Requests welcomed.
